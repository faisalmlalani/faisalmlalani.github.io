              <p>In following up with the spirit of optimism from last week’s post, I’ll be covering stories exemplifying the true nature of our situation — not the apocalyptic stifling of society caused by a pandemic, but a hopeful global solidarity in the face of adversity.</p>

<p><strong>Heroes</strong> refers to the people working tirelessly to sustain this hope. They’re representing what humanity can and should be like. It’s easy to swipe left on society as we read headlines about the folks fighting over the last pack of toilet paper, or trolls hijacking online classes on Zoom, but this is not who we are as a community. This type of news is news because it stands out amidst the countless efforts being done by the doctors in hospitals, the volunteers collecting food donations, and the everyday citizens doing their part by self-isolating.</p>

<p>It’s during hard times that you see what people are really like — and I want to share the stories of a few community efforts that are representing the best of us.</p>

<p>This does not mean I’m trying to minimize the devastation. The struggles and suffering of the heroes in hospitals are very real and cannot be understated. There are legitimate concerns in terms of human rights violations, misinformation spread, and political instability. People everywhere are dying — and we need to take all of it seriously.</p>

<p>With that being said, hope also needs to be taken seriously. It’s one of our most powerful weapons against any threat — public health catastrophe or otherwise. And this isn’t just preachy babble: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=medical+studies+altruism+hope&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">you can read a number of medical studies that cite the psychological effects of altruism as the deciding factor in whether a patient survives their trauma or not.</a></p>

<p><strong>It’s easy to laugh off something as abstract and idealistic as hope; what takes real courage is rising above cynicism and being a reason for others to do the same.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-musicians">The Musicians</h2>

<p><em>I am not a doctor, I cannot heal people, but I can give hope and I can make people fly with me, at least for 5 minutes a day.</em> - <strong>Aldo Cicchini</strong></p>

<p>Over the past month, it seems as if Italy has been the lowest hanging fruit for news organizations ready to shine a light on countries affected most by the coronavirus. It’s not hard to find headlines painting the country as a desolate shell of its former self.</p>

<p>Italy’s musicians beg to differ. They’re the ones playing their pianos and violins out their windows, bringing a symphonic bliss to isolation.</p>

<h2 id="the-innovators">The Innovators</h2>
<p>Complacency is yet another victim of the coronavirus; fortunately, when complacency dies, the fires in the eyes of engineers, developers, and scientists of the world come alive.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/news/3d-printed-valves-covid-19-italy/">3D printing ventilator valves in Brescia</a> to <a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/two-ut-students-launch-website-that-tracks-store-inventories">tracking the essential supplies of local grocery stores in Austin</a>, innovators of all ages are pulling out their metaphorical toolboxes and getting to work on creative solutions to the new, pandemic-related problems of our time.</p>

<p>The United Nations has even called for <a href="https://www.talenthouse.com/i/united-nations-global-call-out-to-creatives-help-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19">an open brief to all creators</a> to help the world through these troubling times by building something to encourage social distancing, stop the spread of misinformation, make donating more accessible, and more.</p>

<h2 id="the-influencers">The Influencers</h2>

<p>It seems the positivity train is picking up steam: celebrities with far more star power than I are amplifying the optimism of the masses.</p>

<p>The most notable is John Krasinski’s new YouTube Series, <em>Some Good News</em>, in which he gathers up the positive stories of thousands of fans and presents them in a low-budget, high-quality format. He’s even interviewing some of them, including a cancer patient who finally finished her chemotherapy treatment.</p>

<p>Jim Halpert gets it. He’s not preaching absurdities or spreading his own propaganda, he’s sharing the experiences of the community. <strong>That’s how any social change starts — amplifying the existing good.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-people">The People</h2>

<p>The soldiers at the front lines are the health workers in hospitals, and despite their courage, diligence, and dexterity, the overwhelming impact of the virus is enough to impact the psychological underpinnings of any individual.</p>

<p>What we do as outside the hospital can directly impact those inside; not just by flattening the curve, but by collective gratitude. Ask any sports fan how beneficial home-field advantage is to a team; the moral boost provided by your community is literally a game-changer.</p>

<p>The UK, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and India are all taking this to heart, cheering on from their metaphorical stands through their windows and balconies.</p>

<h2 id="the-streamers">The Streamers</h2>

<p>I pointed out last week how much I enjoy the gaming community. A big reason for that is that I value streamers: people who record themselves playing or commentating on games while a large audience watches and contributes through donations and comments.</p>

<p><strong>This embodies what I love most about technology: the spirit of community amplified beyond the confines of physical borders.</strong></p>

<p>Lately, the streaming framework has extended to other groups: coders, artists, musicians, authors, and so, so many more.</p>

<h2 id="the-students">The Students</h2>

<p>Fortunately, COVID-19’s effect on youth is minimal. Unfortunately, despite only showing mild symptoms, students still have to stay home from school due to their high risk of being carriers of the virus.</p>

<p>Many students are making the most of their heightened immunity and increased free time by forming in groups and offering their services to less-fortunate demographics.</p>

<p><a href="https://apnews.com/bda9c1ed0f8e10742ad2feabb2d52aa2">Invisible Hands</a> is one of these groups. Their website allows at-risk populations - the elderly, large families - to request volunteers to deliver groceries and other essentials to their doorstep.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/health/medical-students-coronavirus.html">Other students are collecting thousands of masks, baby- or pet-sitting for health workers, and organizing community food donation drives.</a></p>

<p>Oh, and they’re building <em>robots</em> too.</p>

<h2 id="the-health-workers">The Health Workers</h2>

<p>Doctors and nurses everywhere deserve a parade after all this is over. This is something everyone agrees on, so I want to take a moment to specifically highlight the health workers in poorer countries.</p>

<p>Right now, the focus is on countries like the United States, Italy, and China. As seasonality comes into play, underserved countries (especially those in the Southern Hemisphere) will feel the worst effects of COVID-19, if they haven’t already. Many of these places have health systems that contain incredibly low ratios of doctors to patients. More so, while we can sign a 2 trillion dollar stimulus package to help our economy, these poorer countries already burdened with debt will find it next to impossible to service their already impoverished health systems.</p>

<p>Existing <em>international</em> inequalities will widen, and it’ll be up to us to keep the pressure on the right people to get cheap, accessible testing to these nations. By doing our part, we can support the already strained doctors who have the increased stress of dealing with a country in poverty. Citizens are much less likely to practice social distancing due to the circumstances of their poorer conditions, and as a result more and more people are likely to get sick. They’re also at a terrifying risk of starvation and other illnesses as they’re forced to stay home to prevent the spread of COVID-19; we’re lucky enough to have a home to be isolated to — for many, they have nowhere but work to be. Population density, improper testing, inept leadership — these problems now not only exist in impoverished countries, they’re being defined by them.</p>

<p>This is not to say that their situation is hopeless. Health workers are still out there, showing up daily despite the situation looking bleaker for them than anywhere else in the world. International efforts through GAVI, the Gates Foundation, Global Health Security Agenda, and WHO are funding the safety gear, therapeutics, vaccines, and other necessities. Further, the restless citizens of these countries aren’t just sitting around watching — homeless shelters are being constructed, food packages are being sent out, celebrities are donating millions, locals are spreading fundraising requests on social media.</p>

<p>But still — <strong>remember the impoverished; they’ll be the ones still suffering when more developed health systems alleviate concerns for the rest of us.</strong></p>
