            <div class="article-content">
              <p>About a year ago, I had a vision. It wasn’t a vision of anything substantial or of particular nuance, but it still gripped me. I thought about it obsessively during those few months before I left for India, which was strange for me - the scope of my daydreams usually only stretched to the most upcoming adventure, never the inevitable one after. The scene I was envisioning was articulated one day in class, when my professor noticed my trademark absentmindedness.</p>

<p><em>“What’re you thinkin’ about there, Faisal?”</em></p>

<p><em>“Uh, I’ve been thinking about- well, this is going to sound weird, but I’m completely serious. I want to ride a camel in the Sahara Desert.”</em></p>

<p><em>“…alright then, buddy, you do that.”</em></p>

<p><em>“I will actually! I think I’ll go next summer, maybe.”</em></p>

<p><em>“Send me an email when you get there.”</em></p>

<p>I could tell neither him nor my classmates really believed me (especially based on the quizzical looks on their faces), but a lot of them didn’t know that I’d bungee jumped off of a bridge in Nepal a year prior or lived briefly in the Himalayas. My eccentric madness and unnatural ability to find myself in impossible worldly situations were qualities that were always suppressed when I returned to life back home.</p>

<p>Returning from my travels always plagued me with feelings of resentment towards home. The physical challenges and emotional tolls I endured - whether I’m attempting to surf in African waters near Cape Town or boarding with orphans in one of the world’s poorest villages - are disparities from normalcy I crave in my day-to-day. This hunger for adventure was getting desperate, and so naturally (at least, to me) the thought of adding another absurdity to my bucket list kept me sane throughout my time back in university.</p>

<p>The vision itself was of a future-me; skinnier and more fit, wearing something <em>cool</em>. Like a ragged scarf and a Henley. The camel I was riding, the desert environment around me - these were all imaginary factors derived from some movie I might’ve watched or video game I may have played. And there was some element of danger involved, because for some reason I believed that if there wasn’t, then the dream was too good for me.</p>

<p>Now let’s fast-forward past further inner misery. And then fast-forward again past my time in India and the experience of loving friendships, engaging research, jungle expeditions in search of tigers, explorations of ancient ruins, motorcycle rides through Heaven on Earth (Ladakh), and lots and lots of Butter Chicken.</p>

<p>All of these adventures were apart of my time working for Microsoft Research in India. I was to be there for six months, and upon conclusion the research institution would fund my trip back home. But thanks to my impulsive recklessness, I may have told Human Resources that my home was in Northern Africa… in Morocco… by the Sahara.</p>

<p>My dream of riding that camel was still very, very much alive. Still impractical, but alive.</p>

<p>And then there I was.</p>

<p>Morocco.</p>

<p><em>The city of Fes.</em></p>

<p>You know, I really did attempt to have a plan here. I wasn’t crazy enough to just fly into a community with a vastly unique culture located halfway around the world without a plan! Nu-uh, not for a fourth time.</p>

<p>I arrived with extreme excitement on the surface and deep sadness in the heart (remember, I had just left India!). But it was a beautiful sadness, and one that made me yearn for life. And I made sure to actively seek it in Morocco.</p>

<p>I was alone, and I made the most of it by attempting to befriend everyone without shame. I would join tour groups with fellow tourists I knew nothing about; I would laugh with locals on the side of the street about my outlandish demeanor; and mostly, I would bounce from experience to experience, attempting to understand the delightful new world I was in through playful dialogue and naive inquiry.</p>

<p>I was happy. Really, really happy. It was genuine, and it was in these times I felt more than ever that I could do anything because the world really was a delightful place.</p>

<p><em>The cooks of a small cafe I would eat at. They were always full of laughter and we would playfully tease each other about our cultures.</em></p>

<p>The day I planned to go to the Sahara was a hectic one. I don’t know how many times I’ve said this over the past couple of years, but my plan had gone to hell. I didn’t know where I was going, and I was happy. Whether these were mutually exclusive of one another or correlated, I’ll let you decide.</p>

<p>I had learned from new local friends that going to the Sahara alone was rare due to the expense and feat of traveling alone so far in a place so desolate. Funnily enough, hearing these warnings reminded me of my classmates in disbelief when I initially expressed my desire to come to the Sahara. This time, I simply laughed and went about finding a ride to take me to the edge of the desert.</p>

<p>Thanks to some new connections I’d made through the locals, I was able to secure transportation and a spot in a desert camp. I had no idea what any of that entailed, so when my ride dropped me off in the middle of nowhere eight hours from Fes, I was lost. But not too lost. Kind of like an optimistic lost.</p>

<p>In front of me lied the Sahara Desert, that much was clear.</p>

<p><em>The Sahara, at last.</em></p>

<p>Behind me were several old buildings that looked like ruins I’d seen in my time in India. One of them seemed open and inviting, so I meandered in. There was a small pool placed in front of a central room surrounded by a border of other rooms; this was most definitely some sort of desert “resort,” though the sight of degraded walls and smell of camel dung made me think to put quotes around the word “resort” if I ever blogged about this place.</p>

<p>A manager at the front welcomed me, in Arabic. I asked him, politely, where the hell I was, and he said, in Arabic, something. And that’s when I nodded, politely, and went right back outside, contemplating the absurdity of the situation at hand.</p>

<p>As I sat by the pool trying to get signal on my phone so I could contact the driver who dropped me off here, three saviors came bursting out of a nearby room, laughing. Two looked and sounded like locals from a neighboring African country, while the third was very clearly American. The three jumped into the pool and played around like I remember my childhood friends and I used to in our neighborhood pool. Except these guys were, of course, doing it in the Sahara Desert.</p>

<p><em>“Hi!! Are you guys part of an excursion here?“</em></p>

<p><em>“Yes we are, friend. Where you from? You sound American, like this fool *Kevin over here.“</em></p>

<p>Kevin the American splashed water on him. They laughed and teased each other a bit before I replied.</p>

<p><em>“Yes, I- actually I’m from India.”</em></p>

<p>It was a new habit I was trying to form. Growing up Indian in the States naturally led to a sort of shame at that part of my identity, but my recent time there had instilled a pride in my birth country I’d never had before.</p>

<p>I learned that the other two were called *Oki and *Rai. All of three of them were from Uganda, and all three of them were absolutely fascinating in their own rights. Rai, for instance, was on a journey to photograph and document the personal history of every local and culture in the African continent. Oki was the head of a travel agency that partnered with the international school Kevin taught at. Each of them told me their stories with the kind of excitement I found so hard to articulate but easy to feel. They spoke with me and laughed with me as if I had known them for years, and when I told them about my story, they replied with equal fascination.</p>

<p><em>“Why don’t you come to the camp with us? You are alone no more!“</em></p>

<p><em>“Seriously!? I would love to! Thank you!!“</em></p>

<p>And with that, Oki, Rai, and Kevin welcomed me into their desert expedition group. We were to take off with a larger group of about 20, with some North African Berbers who would be guiding us to the camp.</p>

<p>As the camels were rounded up, we tied our scarves around our necks and some over our heads. It wasn’t as windy as we expected, and the sky was getting cloudier by the second. This worried me especially, because star-gazing in the middle of the desert was something I knew to be revered by many. But I pushed the worries aside as one of the Berbers called me over to board my very own Sahara-Desert-Camel.</p>

<p>I hopped on the camel, which the Berber told me was named A’ayoof. I called him Herald.</p>

<p>Herald lurched back and forth as I climbed on, and I almost fell off. I heard Rai, who had taken control of the camel behind me smoothly, laughing. His appearance oozed character: the professional camera hung around his neck, the lion-print scarf around his neck and over his head, the array of bright-colored clothing; I made a mental note to exercise my identity more as I turned away from him.</p>

<p>The two-hour camel ride towards our camp exemplified the feeling of intense motivation and joy tenfold. I remember my mind, for the first time in a long time - maybe for the first time in my entire life - was at ease. And it wasn’t exactly a meditative environment: the Sahara was undergoing a full-on assault on my senses, as I wiped away sand blown into my mouth and attempted to cover my nose to combat the smell of the camel’s aggressive farts.</p>

<p>But we were all beside ourselves at the thought that we were riding A CAMEL IN THE SAHARA DESERT. Or maybe that was just me. I repeated that mantra over and over in my head, and each time my happiness grew, more and more. I was here, really here!</p>

<p><em>The Berber (in blue), my Ugandan friends (behind me), and me.</em></p>

<p>Let me tell you now with first-hand experience, riding camels is NOT a comfortable experience. Not too long after the sounds of jubilance and camera shutters filled the desert air, groans and complaints about our aching groins were all that we heard. The Berbers, meanwhile, were laughing at our discomfort. One of them decided to start taunting us:</p>

<p><em>“Enjoying the ride, American?“</em></p>

<p>“Eyes forward China-man!“_</p>

<p><em>“Hey, Shah Rukh Khan! What you doing all the way out here!?“</em></p>

<p>The last one was clearly directed at me, the only Indian of the group. I chose to ignore the casual racism, reminding myself that he’s probably endured the ignorance and complaints of hundreds, if not thousands, of tourists riding his camels.</p>

<p><em>“AIIEEE! You from Africa, right? AIEEE!”</em></p>

<p>This one was directed at Oki, who chose to laugh at the Berber’s attempts to mock some sort of tribal screech. I admired that carefree nature, and vowed to adopt it as the same Berber asked me how much curry I brought it in my backpack.</p>

<p>Finally, we reached the desert camp. There were several tents laid out in a horseshoe shape, surrounded by miles and miles of sand on any given side. We disembarked our camels, and gathered in the center of the camp, awaiting further instruction, and hopefully, dinner.</p>

<p>It was getting late now, and we knew with nightfall would come a substantial drop in temperature. I stared hopefully at the sky, hoping to see some sign of migrating clouds, but no luck yet.</p>

<p>We all sat in chairs laid out for us for one hour, two hours, three. No sign from the Berbers yet. We passed the time in conversation; Oki, Rai, and Kevin asked me many questions about my time in Nepal, wondering how I could afford to spend so much time in other countries while I was still in university. I pressed them for more details on their travels, and Oki told me the tale of an eventful train ride they had on the way from Casablanca:</p>

<p><em>“A little boy, no older than six, he keeps patting his mother on her arm as she try to sleep. And his poor mother, bless her heart, she worked so much during the day! I know this because I can see how tired she is. So we say to the boy “why don’t you leave your mother to sleep and talk to us?” And the boy, he babbles on and on about Harry Potter and Superman and so, so, many things. And we listened intently! What a boy, what a boy he was. He was so confident. He told us that when he grows older he would help his mother and make their family rich so his mother did not have to work anymore. He put his arms on his hips, puffed out his little chest, and said he was going to be Superman.“</em></p>

<p>With the way Oki spoke, each word of his tale was powered by emotion. You could tell that what he was saying wasn’t just what he thought, but also what he <em>felt</em>. He spoke with a tone that made you want to hear every detail just so you could continue to enveloped in that passion towards people that Oki seemed to exuberate. He loved life and was excited about it, and I was all for it.</p>

<p><em>“Oh, Faisal. It’s been so good seeing the world with these fools. We laughed, and laughed, and laughed.“</em></p>

<hr />

<p>We had dinner close to midnight. It was an intimate setting, as all 20 of us had to squeeze into a small-ish tent with small-ish tables. We enjoyed introducing each other and teasing Oki and Rai, who were the most vocal among us. Both of them seemed to have that indispensable gift of reaching out to people, no matter where they were from or what they looked like. The laughter that echoed from them was just as pure as anyone else’s, they might say.</p>

<p>Returning to the tents, I saw something that made my heart leap - the clouds were disappearing! I excitedly pointed it out to my new friends and we came up with the brilliant idea of dragging our blankets and mattresses, provided to us by the Berbers, out into the sand so we could stargaze as we fell asleep. Other campers saw what we were doing and followed suit, and soon about half the camp had settled down on the outskirts of our designated area. We anxiously awaited for every cloud to vanish, so we could take in the vastness of the universe with the utmost clarity.</p>

<p><em>“What… are… you… doing!?“</em></p>

<p>The Berber was back. And by the sound of it, he was not too impressed with our setup. We defended our misconduct by citing the beauty of the stars. He relented, and decided to sit with us.</p>

<p>I turned my attention back to the sky. It was almost 1:30am, and the bed of twinkles contrasted so perfectly with the darkness that it was difficult to comprehend how such a sight can be deserved to be seen by people who aid so heavily in blocking it.
We were all silent, in awe. And then -</p>

<p><em>“Maybe I tell you joke.”</em></p>

<p>You cannot be serious, I thought. Several of us turned and saw the Berber lean forward in preparation for his attack. Then he struck.</p>

<p><em>“How do you put camel in fridge in 3 steps?”</em></p>

<p>No one spoke.</p>

<p><em>“You open fridge. You put camel in. You close fridge.”</em></p>

<p>Oh my god.</p>

<p>Slight chuckles here and there, followed by an unconscious consensus to deny those words were ever uttered.</p>

<p>At that moment, a shooting star streaked across the plane, and many of us gasped.</p>

<p><em>“Maybe… I tell you more joke.”</em></p>

<p>Thinking back on it, I think the Berber thought we were reacting to his first punchline. Whatever the case, he seemed to think he was a big hit because he had another one coming.</p>

<p><em>“How do you put an elephant in the fridge? In 4 steps!”</em></p>

<p>…</p>

<p><em>“You open fridge. You take camel out. You put elephant in. Then you close fridge!”</em></p>

<p>I’ll give him credit, because this time he actually got a laugh or two. But most of us were still actively scouting for another shooting star. Then Oki yelled loudly -</p>

<p><em>“OH!”</em></p>

<p>We turned our attention to him. Had he found another shooting star, maybe?</p>

<p><em>“It’s the same fridge!!”</em></p>

<p>Rai loudly facepalms, and everyone bursts out laughing, loud enough to catch the attention of other Berbers and campers, who come by to see what was so funny in the Sahara Desert.</p>

<p>Oki’s remark broke the strict sense of awe and for the rest of the night, we all took turns delivering jokes and asking riddles. To tease Oki, we would repeat his comment back upon hearing a new punchline.</p>

<p><em>“A doctor and his patient walk into a bar -“</em></p>

<p><em>“Wait - was it the same fridge?”</em></p>

<p>The laughter echoed throughout the camp, and eventually most people were out and about, pointing up at the sky to point out the glorious form of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>The Berber, still relentless, kept offering more dumb jokes. This time, he demanded that we make the sound of sheep if we could not figure out the punchline.</p>

<p><em>“You must ‘baaaaaaa’ if you do not know the answer!”</em></p>

<p>And so we “baaaaaaa”ed. Or at least, some of us did.</p>

<p><em>“Shah Rukh Khan, you are not ‘baaaaaaa’ing! I will not reveal joke until you ‘baaaaaaaa.’</em></p>

<p>And so, with the encouragement of my new friends, I “baaaaaaaa”ed into the night, while laying down in the middle of the Sahara Desert, next to snoring camels and comedic North African Berbers.</p>

<p>And the whole time, we laughed, and laughed, and laughed.</p>
