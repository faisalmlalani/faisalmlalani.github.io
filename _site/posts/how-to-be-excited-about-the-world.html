            <div class="article-content">
              <p>There is a LOT to be excited about. Yes, even now.</p>

<p>I’m known (and sometimes even reprimanded) for a trademark optimism that may overtake justified reasons to be cynical. My tendency to look at things this way has been stated more than once to border on plain naivety, but I want to try to explain my outlook, and how easy I think it is to achieve.</p>

<p>I think it’s important to start by pointing out that it’s not like I’m happy all the time. Or excited. Or really, any single emotion. The human experience is far too nuanced for a single emotion at any given time.</p>

<p>Right now I’m stuck in quarantine like all of you and I’m sad I can’t travel, to another city, or to the gym for that matter. However, I’m also feeling incredibly inspired by the stories I hear about the lengths everyday citizens are going to to reach out to members of their community affected at a larger scale by the pandemic.</p>

<p>Yes, there are those who are handling the situation with less… dignity than one might hope for, but no narrative, good or bad, exists in isolation. It’s perfectly fine to get discouraged reading stories about people hoarding toilet paper, but it’s not okay to forget the high schoolers picking up groceries for the unable elderly.</p>

<p>Adopting a more optimistic outlook is more than just favorable conditions around you. <strong>The goal is remaining optimistic even when you’re backed into a corner and it seems like the world is against you.</strong> I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been stranded in the middle of nowhere in some foreign country or been dropped in a situation designed to induce the depths of my anxiety. But eventually, it got easier. Not just because I got smarter or more physically able — but because I got <em>excited</em> about being challenged, about being pushed to my limits and letting the world know what I was made of. <strong>That’s the key — get excited when you’re faced with problems, and even you’ll be surprised at how strong you are.</strong></p>

<p>I’ve come to think of this idea of becoming excited as a skill, because like I said, it’s something that gets easier over time. Below, I have some surefire ways to help you develop that skill. Don’t worry — it’s not some abstract philosophical soul-searching or common-sense tidbits like “just smile” (though that always helps).</p>

<h2 id="immerse-yourself-in-a-niche-community">Immerse yourself in a niche community</h2>
<p>I am not a gamer, but I LOVE the gaming community.</p>

<p>I have no consoles or a computer capable of playing mainstream video games, but I still avidly follow different gaming fandoms. On reddit, I’m subscribed to specific gaming subreddits like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/">/r/Breath_Of_The_Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/">/r/AnimalCrossing</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/">/r/GodOfWar</a> even though I don’t own any of these games and have not played them. On YouTube, I routinely watch game development videos and get swept down the rabbit hole of gaming analysis videos for video games I’d never even heard of before, like Hollow Knight.</p>

<p>And it’s not just in the gaming landscape that I obsessively follow communities; I keep a close eye on hobbyists, TV show fandoms, writers, philosophers, economists, and designers despite me not being directly involved in any of them.</p>

<p>Communities, specifically niche communities involving a small group of people excited about a hobby or sport or any medium, are personifications of passion. You may not have something in your immediate metaphorical vicinity to be excited about, but I can guarantee you that somebody somewhere is geeking out about something.</p>

<p>Go to any social media platform, and search for them. Branch your search using your own existing interests and once you find a group — read all about them. <strong>Look at their fan art, adopt their eccentric behaviors without judgement, and lose yourself in this community united in their collective love of whatever fiction they embrace.</strong></p>

<p><em>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/">/r/AnimalCrossing</a> community on reddit; I know nothing about the game, but the people are delightful.</em></p>

<h2 id="read-read-read">Read, read, READ</h2>
<p>I read a LOT. My room is filled with piles of books, all topped with a Kindle cherry which contains even more books.</p>

<p>When I first picked up the habit, it was hard for me to get far into a book without zoning out. There’s always so much else to think about, and the black-and-white pages in front of me were always the least of my concerns.</p>

<p>But then something magical happened. I had finished reading <em>Can’t Hurt Me</em> by David Goggins, an engaging auto-biography of an ex-Navy Seal. I was now making my way through <em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em>, and I read his take on how the attitude we have towards our suffering defines us. My mind automatically connected this to what Goggins says in his book about suffering, and I start thinking about how similar their philosophies are. Then I think about an article I read about an Indian villager and his hopelessness in the face of an illness.</p>

<p>Do you see the magic yet? <strong>Once you start reading, your mind activates a silenced framework of thoughts that connect to each other and builds upon it.</strong> No matter what it is. The example I provided above is pretty abstract, but this happens with any subject and any book. This goes for fiction, too. I recently finished <em>Born a Crime</em> by Trevor Noah, in which he describes his experience growing up in South Africa during apartheid. At the same time, I read <em>Red Rising</em>, a sci-fi novel about a new caste system humans put together when we migrate to Mars in the future. My experience learning about Noah’s life and as well as the societal effects of apartheid was so much easier retained because I visualized similar conditions in a fiction I read on the side.</p>

<p>Notable readers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTFy8RnUkoU">Bill Gates</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfre0a?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">Elon Musk</a> swear by this as well. It’s how they learn so much — their knowledge builds upon itself because of the framework activated by reading so much.</p>

<p>Having all of these thoughts and information connect to each other sounds overwhelming, but it actually gives you a lot to be excited about. First, you’ll feel incredibly empowered because of your newfound knowledge and mindset. And second, you’ll realize there’s a lot more depth to the world than what you may initially perceived. <strong>There’s so much to discover, so much to marvel at, that even your worst cynical impulses would be excited.</strong></p>

<h2 id="reach-out-to-brilliant-people">Reach out to brilliant people</h2>
<p>Assuming you’re following this procedurally, now that you’ve developed that mental framework, there is so much you can <em>share</em>.</p>

<p>I’m extremely introverted, and yet I now very much enjoy having conversations with as many people as possible because I have a lot I want to chat about — the complexities of global health, the absurdity of quantum computing, the economics behind a data tax. There are SO many amazing things to dive into, and the beauty of swimming in the waters of all of it with others make it much more exciting.</p>

<p><strong>The key here is to go beyond your immediate social circle.</strong> It’s actually pretty easy to reach out to anyone you want to speak to these days, be it a renowned researcher who wrote a paper you found intriguing, or the head of an organization or project you’re really inspired by.</p>

<p>First, try for a simple introductory email. Don’t be too formal, because we’re humans, and no matter what you highfalutin business majors might say, people get bored reading the hundredth email starting with your formal dribble.</p>

<p>The general rule is if you don’t hear back within 3-4 days, send a follow-up. Nothing lengthy; indicate you’re simply aiming to stay on their radar. People are busy, it’s nothing personal.</p>

<p>At this point, also scavenge through your social circle to find any possible indirect connections to the person you’re targeting. Professors are a perfect middleman for this type of thing, but if you can’t find even them, your best bet is to set your sights lower and attempt to connect with someone who directly knows the target and who may be more likely to reply. Then rinse, and repeat the steps above.</p>

<p>Don’t get discouraged if this sounds like too much; it may be difficult the first time, but as you develop connections, you’ll find it easier and easier to add more. And what’s more — people will reach out to <em>you</em>! By making that first move and reaching out, you’ll soon find yourself in a natural network of brilliant and passionate people talking about exciting things.</p>

<h2 id="participate">PARTICIPATE</h2>
<p><strong>Don’t, by any means, ever get complacent. If you get complacent, cynicism wins.</strong></p>

<p>One of the most obvious forms of participation is voting. Think of voting as an extension of your identity as a person. How fortunate are we to live in a society in which we can literally have a say on how the world is shaped? And if you think it’s pointless, then <em>do more</em>. Organize your local community and form a coalition for action. Start a program that exemplifies your belief for social change. Make yourself heard through digital activism.</p>

<p>More so, the scope of participating reaches beyond social action. I would argue that the expression of self is a cosmic obligation for anyone; how can you keep all the things you’ve learned, the laughs you’ve shared, the art you’ve created, the wisdom you’ve accumulated, the lessons you’ve embraced, the potentialities you’ve reached all to yourself?</p>

<p>Host a talk, write a blog, start a YouTube channel, build a robot — <strong>do <em>something</em> with all of your everything!</strong></p>

<p>Just don’t do nothing. There is nothing worse than good people who do nothing.</p>

<p><em>A talk about my travels I gave to my local community.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>The <em>Here’s To Life</em> project was started with these principles in mind. It’s completely understandable how difficult it is to be optimistic when everything you hear is negative. The nature of media, however, is inconsistent with the nature of good news. Progress occurs over a period of time, and the news reports on what happens <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>More so, much of the good news shared is often presented in an un-engaging way, usually through charts or statistics.  <strong>The best way to remain optimistic is to share stories.</strong> Everything I wrote above is indicative of this message. I don’t think there’s anything particularly special in any of it, because they’re all incredibly accessible. However, what is special is how I originated the content based on my own unique experiences traveling abroad. I’m excited about the world because I’ve listened to the stories of people I don’t know, people that aren’t like me, people that don’t think the way I do. That understanding is rooted in any optimism I carry with me.</p>

<p>I implore you to share your stories. I’ll do my part through this project, and work to share the tales of the people out there who inspire me. Their stories are what get me excited about the world, and I hope they’ll do the same for you.</p>
