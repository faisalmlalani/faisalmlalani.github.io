In following up with the spirit of optimism from last week’s post, I’ll be covering stories exemplifying the true nature of our situation — not the apocalyptic stifling of society caused by a pandemic, but a hopeful global solidarity in the face of adversity.

__Heroes__ refers to the people working tirelessly to sustain this hope. They’re representing what humanity can and should be like. It’s easy to swipe left on society as we read headlines about the folks fighting over the last pack of toilet paper, or trolls hijacking online classes on Zoom, but this is not who we are as a community. This type of news is news because it stands out amidst the countless efforts being done by the heroes in hospitals, the volunteers collecting food donations, and the everyday citizens doing their part by self-isolating.

It’s during hard times that you see what people are really like — and I want to share the stories of a few community efforts that are representing the best of us.

This does not mean I’m trying to minimize the devastation. The struggles and suffering of the heroes in hospitals are very real and cannot be understated. There are legitimate concerns in terms of human rights violations, misinformation spread, and political instability. People everywhere are dying — and we need to take all of it seriously.

With that being said, hope also needs to be taken seriously.  It’s one of our most powerful weapons against any threat — public health catastrophe or otherwise. And this isn’t just preachy babble: [you can read a number of medical studies that cite the psychological effects of altruism as the deciding factor in whether a patient survives their trauma or not.](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=medical+studies+altruism+hope&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)

__It’s easy to laugh off something as abstract and idealistic as hope; what shows real courage is rising above cynicism and being a reason for others to do the same.__

_I am not a doctor, I cannot heal people, but I can give hope and I can make people fly with me, at least for 5 minutes a day._ - __Aldo Cicchini__

Over the past month, it seems as if Italy has been the lowest hanging fruit for news organizations ready to shine a light on countries affected most by the coronavirus. It’s not hard to find headlines painting the country as a desolate shell of its former self. 

Italy’s musicians beg to differ. They’re the ones playing their pianos and violins out their windows, bringing a symphonic bliss to isolation.

## Some Good News

It seems the positivity train is picking up steam: celebrities with far more star power than I are amplifying the optimism of the masses. 

The most notable is John Krasinski’s new YouTube Series, /Some Good News/, in which he gathers up the positive stories of thousands of fans and presents them in a low-budget, high-quality format. He’s even interviewing some of them, including a cancer patient who finally finished her chemotherapy treatment.

Jim Halpert gets it. He’s not preaching absurdities or spreading his own propaganda, he’s sharing the experiences of the community. __That’s how any social change starts — amplifying the existing good.__

## Unbound Gratitude

The soldiers at the front lines are the health workers in hospitals, and despite their courage, diligence, and dexterity, the overwhelming impact of the virus is enough to impact the psychological underpinnings of any individual. 

What we do as outside the hospital can directly impact those inside; not just by flattening the curve, but by collective gratitude. Ask any sports fan how beneficial home-field advantage is to a team; the moral boost provided by your community is literally a game-changer.

The UK, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and India are all taking this to heart, cheering on from their metaphorical stands through their windows and balconies.

## The Streamers

I pointed out last week how much I enjoy the gaming community. A big reason for that is that I value streamers: people who record themselves playing or commentating on games while a large audience watches and contributes through donations and comments. 

__This embodies what I love most about technology: the spirit of community amplified beyond the confines of physical borders.__

Lately, the streaming framework has extended to other groups: coders, artists, musicians, authors, and so, so many more.

## The Health Workers
Remember the impoverished - they’ll be the ones still suffering when more developed health systems alleviate concerns of the virus for the rest of us.
