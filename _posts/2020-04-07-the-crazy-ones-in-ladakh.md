_Always go too far, because that’s where you’ll find the truth_ - __Albert Camus__

I don’t know how to ride a motorcycle. This was a slight hiccup in my grand plan to ride a motorcycle.

I was in India just a few months ago, finishing up my internship at Microsoft Research. I was having one of the greatest times of my life, getting to do work I was passionate about, learning from the much smarter researchers around me, and, most importantly, having a really lovely time with my new friends and coworkers.

I had already threw myself in all sorts of exciting experiences during my time in India: by the time I was contemplating my lack of motorcycle-driving capability, I had visited the lively little village of Armori, ventured into the famous Pench Jungle Camp north of Nagpur, and explored the ancient ruins scattered throughout Hampi. This next adventure was to be different — for the past year or so, I had two dreams in mind: ride a camel in the Sahara desert, and ride a horse in the Himalayas. 

The former — riding a camel in the Sahara — seemed far off and undo-able at the time, especially with the way I was spending my money on all these other excursions. [That probably wouldn’t happen anytime soon](https://www.herestolifeproject.com/posts/the-terrible-jokes-of-the-sahara-desert).

The latter, however, was still very much possible, and why shouldn’t it be? I’d been to the Himalayas before, just two years ago prior when I was living in Nepal. So I knew I was capable of withstanding the intensity of the environment. Furthermore, I was on the other side of the mountain giants this time, and it was unique enough to warrant paying for another trip down there.

For those unaware, the Indian Himalayas, or Ladakh, is a kingdom of mountains that occupy a large part of Kashmir, the disputed territory located in the far north of the Indian subcontinent that’s been rife with human rights violations over the years. In my eyes, Kashmir is a land of contrast: its beauty lies in its mountainous frontiers and more importantly, in its people; but conflict, in its inherent habit of tarnishing beauty, has created an ugly corollary for the protesting locals.

I really don’t want to get into the turmoil in this post, for in this story I simply intend to write about two idiots on a motorcycle. I highly recommend interested readers to do a deeper dive themselves into the history of Ladakh, but for everyone else — continue forth.

---

It’s difficult for me, even now, to articulate my reasons for wanting to go. Most might cite the desire to simply view the beauty of a literal heaven on Earth. Others might consider the incredible thrill of adventure, or something. Maybe my motivation was both, but thinking back on it, I feel as if a large part of much of my recklessness is self-validation. I don’t know what from or even what for, but the idea of me constantly putting myself in these situations makes _me_ cherish life. I live through my stories, for better or worse, and the more absurd they are, the more human I feel.

So where does a motorcycle come in? Well in my research about the region, I found that travelers navigate the mountains one of two ways: booking a car and local driver to take them around (what some may call _the safe way_), or by renting a motorcycle and hitting the mountain roads yourself (what some may call _the less safe way_).  You can guess which one appealed to me.

Now, back to the problem — I didn’t know how to ride a motorcycle. Luckily, I was in _India_, where every second you could hear the rumble, tumble, rattle, and roll of a two-wheeler breezing by your front gate. Unluckily, no one wanted to tag along on my semi-foolish endeavor. Except one person.

Enter Shubham, one of my closest friends I had met during my time in India. He was pretty unexperienced in the art of travel, and so when he accepted my crazy offer, I was pleasantly surprised. I was also aware of my own recklessness and inclination for that recklessness to be realized, and as I planned our trip, I considered the limits of recklessness I could pursue without breaking Shubham.

Eh, I’ll just wing it, I thought.

Stepping out of the airport in Srinagar (the summer capital of Kashmir), Shubham and I were exhausted. We had an extremely early morning flight, which is the core ingredient in the recipe for a bad start for travel in an unknown region. Unfortunately, I am a terrible cook, so that part of my plan did not pan out (okay, no more food puns).

We were to meet with *Karim, owner of the *Zambia houseboat. That’s right — I booked a BOAT to stay in during our time there. From what I’d heard, Srinagar was home to the famous Dal Lake, on top of which floats a thriving marketplace and the homes of ambitious locals welcoming tourists to spend their newly converted currencies on goods and shelter.

_Oh, FINALLY!_

Shubham had just spotted my name on a thin white paper board, being held by a man who looked just like a Karim. I knew, because I have a good intuition for these things.

_I am Suleman. Are you Faisal?_

Okay, maybe not that good of intuition. Also, Suleman? What?

_Faisal. FAISAL!_

Another man approached us. He looked nothing like a Karim though.

_I am Karim. I am your AirBnB host! Excuse this man, Suleman, he wait for another guest, also called Faisal._

This may be a good time to interject with the fact that Kashmir is dominantly Muslim.

_Come, come. We have much to do. Wonderful, wonderful. Come!_

And so we went. Shubham and I followed Karim to his car. Karim kindly narrated for us his take on everything Srinagar, from airport security to the Mughal Gardens. His English wasn’t perfect, so he spoke to us in the world’s most popular language, broken English.

And then finally, we reached Dal Lake.

It was _breathtaking_. I felt as if I was staring at the most beautiful painting I’d ever seen, with the jagged hills making up the background of the canvas and the lively locals and bustling river vendors making up the subject. But most impressive was how colorful it all was; I felt as if I was thrown into a 1992 Bollywood classic.

Karim rowed Shubham and I to his houseboat, the Zambia. It was larger than I expected but smaller than I’d hoped. It didn’t end up mattering either way, because this was meant to be a one-stop shop — the unknown was our destination, and I had no intention of staying longer than 10 minutes on the boat. This was unreasonable, of course, as we were exhausted. And Shubham was going to have none of my tendency to disregard reason.

After some not-so-quick rest, Karim took us around the city to explore. Soldiers were sprinkled throughout the city, providing us with a constant reminder of the entropy. Our tour of temples and trinkets aided in that effort —

Even the end of our day had metaphorical alarm bells about the state of things - we had dinner had _Winterfell_ Cafe. Y’know. Remember the North.

Karim promised Shubham and I that we could go for a sunset boat ride on Dal Lake after dinner. Our boat was slim, but it fit the both of us comfortably enough, and we spent the night navigating the waters of one of the most heavenly places in the region, famously and appropriately called Heaven on Earth.

Salesmen are probably the only vocation in which persistence reeks instead of blossoms, and in India doubly so. Dal Lake, however, seemed to be the exception: the Kashmiri vendors were content with the first _no_.

I remarked to Shubham about another attribute of these vendors that struck out to me.

_These sellers are actually pretty brave. There are tourists here from all over the world; it must be really daunting to reach out to them and ask them to buy your stuff. Kind of crazy actually._

Shubham thought about that for a moment.

_Hmm… maybe only the crazy ones reach out._

We had to get up early again the next morning, for we were to make our way to the center-point of our journey, Leh. Srinagar was a good 10 or so hours away by car, and the drive was extremely dangerous. The narrowness of the roads seemed to match the width of a Queen-sized bed, and there could be two vehicles going back and forth. Furthermore, drives to Leh were done through carpooling. In India, that means filling a car _to the brim_ with passengers. So with all that being said, imagine a completely packed 8-seater car on a literal road from hell driving through a landscape so beautiful it could be from heaven.

We had no choice, it was the cheapest option. Most tourists fly straight to Leh, but my boss denied my request for a raise, even when I citied “pretty cool trip to the Himalayas” on the request form. I personally don’t get why it was denied.

We chugged along the windy roads as we road up and down mountainous terrain, grasping one another’s arms as the car lurched this way and that. Shubham and I made some pretty good friends as we hugged our fellow passengers for dear life. They were all Kashmiri locals, and exhaled their character and their beauty with every breath.

I’m going to interject here and point out that Kashmiri people are _beautiful_. The color of their eyes is the color of the ice that encompasses the frontiers of their land. The first Kashmiri people I saw I thought, _Hm, there’s another few who won the genetic lottery._ Nope. THEY ALL WON.

Our drive was rough, but our fellow passengers made it delightful; they entertained all of my questions, even the most important one -

_Where can I find a place to ride a horse? Also where can I find a horse?_

One of them, a local government worker, laughed and told me that I wouldn’t be able to find one where we were going. The horses were all either privately owned or untamed. That was admittedly a huge blow — horses were a pretty big chunk in my plan to ride a horse in the Himalayas. I had the Himalayas right in front of me, now I needed those beautiful stallions.

When we finally made it to Leh, it was nightfall. The next morning we were to head off on our main adventure — the 3-day motorcycle ride through Ladakh. The excitement was our momentum — we were here, finally here!

Okay, so it wasn’t a roll-out-of-bed, ready, set go the next morning. It was more of an oversleep-stumble-slip (that doesn’t really roll of the tongue as well, does it?). We were anxious, and as we got ready we recounted our meeting the night before.

We had met with our travel advisor, *Timu, after arriving in Leh. He had dropped off our motorcycle, the Bullet. For those unaware --

_Renowned for its idiosyncratic handling as much as for its reliability and durability, the Bullet was a bike that demanded a relationship with its rider. That relationship involved tolerance, patience, and understanding on the part of the rider. In exchange, the Bullet provided the kind of soaring, celestial, wind-weaving pleasure that birds must know, punctuated by not infrequent near-death experiences._ - __Gregory David Roberts__

 I put all my faith in Shubham here, because there was no way in hell I could ride this thing. I had no experience whatsoever riding any sort of two-wheeled vehicle, much less this extravaganza of danger. Don’t get me wrong, I would have happily jumped on and rode it all the way to Kazakstan and back, but I’m also a bit insane. Shubham however, had the sanity and the experience, so he was the designated driver.

Our travel directions were scribbled on a single sheet of paper. We would have no cell service for most of our ride, and so we had to rely on old-fashioned Dora-the-Explorer action to navigate these parts. Timu had warned us how difficult the route was, especially for non-professionals, but what does he know? He’s only a 20-year veteran manager of a tourist agency in the Himalayas. We were fine, I was sure of it. Shubham, I’m not so sure. However, he was geared up and rearing to go, and I was bursting with pride for my friend.

_Photo taken the morning of our endeavor. Alternate title: photo taken moments before disaster._

I grabbed my helmet and put on my bag.

_You don’t want to strap your backpack on the bike?_

Shubham asked me this as he tied his own to the side of the Bullet with the help of one of the hotel staff. I was overly protective of my backpack, as I had chugged it along with me for two years, since I bought it off a street vendor in Kathmandu. It was one of my most prized possessions, and it went with me everywhere.

_I’m good. I don’t think we’ll have space anyway, what with the extra canister of petrol on the side, too._

We jumped on the Bullet, and Shubham started it up. It was uncomfortable from the get-go; I had Shubham’s backpack bristling against my side and the canister of gas behind my left leg. My own backpack was heavy, as it carried pretty much all of my possessions for the trip, so that burden took its toll on my shoulders. I didn’t mind much at that moment — we were about to embark on one of the greatest adventures we’d ever have, and I wasn’t going to let something as petty as discomfort ruin my fun.

As Shubham pulled out of the hotel gates, the staff waved goodbye to us. I was right about to pop with anticipation. I think I even whooped loudly as we rode down our first alleyway.

And then immediately, we crashed.

{% include post-image.html path="documentation/2020-04-07-the-crazy-ones-in-ladakh/6.jpeg" path-detail="documentation/2020-04-07-the-crazy-ones-in-ladakh/6.jpeg" alt="" %}

We had hit an elevated platform on the narrow alleyway. It was hard to discern the obstruction, and we may have also overestimated the ease of navigating an alleyway in the city. We weren’t even in the mountains yet, and we already hit our first roadblock. Luckily, the Bullet was undamaged; we had rented it from Timu, and any scratches or damaged parts would cost us a fortune.

A few local school kids noticed our ineptitude and watched gleefully as we tried to figure out how to get around the platform. A nearby storeowner decided to bestow pity upon us; with strength he seemed to pull from the will of God, he lifted the bike over the elevated platform and wished us on our merry way.

Fortunately, our morale was undamaged. I knew Shubham had a strong character, but I won’t lie: I feared from then that he may succumb to discouragement if too many hiccups plagued our trip. This isn’t a statement about him; any inexperienced traveler can lose confidence in the adventure if it seems like the adventure is losing confidence in them.

We rode out of the town smoothly enough, and made it to the directed entrance of the motorcycle route through the mountains. Shubham pulled up the bike right next to the edge of a small temple overlooking the city of Leh, and we reiterated our plan.

{% include post-image.html path="documentation/2020-04-07-the-crazy-ones-in-ladakh/7.jpeg" path-detail="documentation/2020-04-07-the-crazy-ones-in-ladakh/7.jpeg" alt="" %}
_The edge of Leh._

The goal was to first make it to the Nubra Valley, a vast cradle of nature surrounded by the snowy mountains. Timu had mentioned to me that I _might_ be able to find a horse there, for it was lush and filled with roaming herders offering rides and other interaction with their livestock. Next up was the Pangong Lake, the literal liquid gem of Ladakh. It was the highlight of almost every tourist, and also the physical set of the conclusion to one of my favorite movies, _3 Idiots_. Finally, we would drive back to Leh and head back to Srinagar. All of this in 3 days.

_We can do this. We can do this. We can do this._

I repeated this over, and over, and over again to Shubham. It was more for me than him, because if I started doubting myself, it was all over.

As if to test my self-confidence, a streak of motorcyclists passed us by, adorning both professional gear and skill. One of them stopped to check on us, and was quickly baffled at how amateurish we looked.

_You’re going to get yourselves killed. Go get some actual gear!_

Nothing like the reminder of the threat of death from a stranger to get the endorphins running.

I hopped back on the bike, and we took off up the mountain kings.

---

10 minutes.

That’s how long it took before we noticed something was wrong.  Shubham slowed down a bit.

_Do you smell that?_

I didn’t, at first. I was too focused on the beauty of our surroundings.

Shubham stopped the bike, and we hopped off to investigate. It didn’t take too long to figure it out — the extra canister of gas strapped to the side of the bike had ripped after being scraped continuously on the rugged road. We glanced at the trail behind us and found a long streak of petrol acting as footprints of our short journey thus far.

I quickly unstrapped the canister and covered the hole with my scarf. Shubham searched his bag for something to cover the leak and found a dense piece of plastic, something we were given to hold a souvenir bought earlier.

Phew. Crisis averted.

…right?

We jumped back on the bike and continued forth.

For 10 more minutes.

_It’s not working!_

The smell had returned, and we hopped off to assess the problem once more. The plastic wasn’t working. The hole was too big, and we didn’t have anything to prevent further leakage. And if we risked more trials, who knows how much damage we were doing to the environment?

After some deliberation, Shubham and I agreed to fill the bike up with as much petrol as we could, and leave the canister on the side of the road, with a sign for future (and smarter) travelers to take advantage of.

At this point, we were both a little tuckered out. It had been only 20 minutes into our 3-day journey, and already we had faced a seemingly endless stream of struggle. But I was used to struggle, especially during travel. I was okay; Shubham was who I was worried about.

_How are you holding up?_

_Well, it’s like you said, right? This just means I’m a traveler now! And besides, look at this view!_

Shubham extended his arms out and took it all in. I was elated, and followed.

Seeing the waves upon waves of mountains stretch out behind a death machine adorned with our scrappy gear really put things in perspective.

_Our horse._

---

The next hour passed without further complication. The weather got harsher and harsher as we drove on. The wind was heavy, the cold heavier.

We rode in silence, and we rode uphill: 16,000 ft, 16,500 ft, 17,000 ft… when we reached 17,500 ft, Shubham started wondering if we had taken a wrong turn somewhere.

Our only directions were scribbled on the sheet of paper Timu provided, and it mainly consisted of bullet points of places to stop.

So I did what any good explorer would do, and pointed forward and said, _that way_.

Once we got above 18,000 ft, a small clearing came into view. Soldiers were scattered around, along with a few other travelers huddled up together. On the left —

A cup of hot chocolate on the top of the world? That’s as legitimate as any story I’d ever heard. And I was keen on telling it one day.

As soon as we hopped off the bike and the adrenaline died down a little, we felt it. The air was thin up here. So thin, that one of the soldiers approached us and warned that we could only stop here for about 20 minutes max. Otherwise, we would faint as a result of the thin air.

Fair point, I thought. But the hot chocolate was calling, and to me, that was more important than anything he’d said. It’s funny — when you’re freezing cold, dizzy to the point of faint, and on the edge of the world, the mind doesn’t focus on survival, at least immediately. At least not mine. Mine wanted some hot chocolate, and I’d be damned if I was going to let the wrath of the Himalayas prevent me from getting some.

{% include post-image.html path="documentation/2020-04-07-the-crazy-ones-in-ladakh/9.jpeg" path-detail="documentation/2020-04-07-the-crazy-ones-in-ladakh/10.jpeg" alt="" %}

We were in and out quickly. 10 minutes remained on the clock before the soldier claimed we would pass out.

Snow had started to fall, and it was getting intense. So intense that it was difficult to see what was in front of us. We scurried toward our bike, until I saw a sign.

It was a checkpoint marker, with writing that indicated our accomplishment at coming this far.

_Let’s go take a picture real quick!_

_Dude, we don’t have time, we gotta go!_

There was 5 minutes left.

_It’ll just be a second. When are we ever going to get the chance to do this again?_

_Knowing you, probably next week._

I waved him off and ran over. A couple of other motorcyclists were standing in front, taking a snapshot of their own aspirations come true.

My hands were frozen solid at this point, even through my gloves. But this was important to me. I took off the gloves, grabbed my phone and got ready to take a selfie, until a voice behind us called out.

_You actually made it!_

It was the cyclist who stopped us in the beginning of our journey.

_Come here, I’ll take it._

He had a whimsical smile, as if he was amused at the fact that two idiots defied all odds and rode one of the world’s most dangerous motorcycles to the top of the Himalayas. He carried that smile all the way up to the point where he took our photo.

Then, as if it was his role to designate warnings to us, he said:

_Road’s going to be closed! Snow is too much. You probably need to turn back. You’ve reached far enough._

This couldn’t be far enough. Even though we were only a few hours into our multi-day journey, it felt like we had traveled through hell and back just to get here. We couldn’t just turn back now.

He didn’t. The messenger of warnings went back to his troupe and they all hollered in jubilation. It was a celebratory whoop, one that told the soldiers, the other travelers, and the whole damn world that they were ready to go too far. Then, they drove forth.

As we looked on to the spot they drove off from, the feeling of external despair came back. Internally, however, I was thinking about what Shubham said a couple nights ago, as we drifted on the surface of Dal Lake.

_Maybe only the crazy ones reach out._

We jumped back on the bike, and followed onward. To too far.

Due to the length of the experience, I’ve decided to separate this story into 2 parts. Check back __next Tuesday, Apr 13__ for Part II!
